🔐 Smart Deadbolt Lock

A collaborative project by Group KAJ
This repository contains the source code for a Smart Deadbolt Lock system designed with both RFID authentication and a keypad entry system. It uses a servo motor to control locking/unlocking, while LED indicators and a buzzer provide user feedback.

🚀 Features
Dual Authentication Options
- RFID sensor for card/tag access
- Keypad for passcode entry

Outputs
- Servo motor to engage/disengage lock
- Buzzer for alerts (success, error, tamper detection, etc.)
- LEDs for visual status indicators

Open Source
- Free to use for personal and small projects (credit required).
- For commercial or large-scale projects, please contact us for inquiries.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- RFID Sensor Module (e.g., MFRC522)
- Matrix Keypad
- Servo Motor 
- Buzzer
- LEDs + Resistors
- Microcontroller (Arduino)

📖 Usage
- Scan a registered RFID card or enter a valid passcode on the keypad.
- If authentication is successful, the servo unlocks the deadbolt.
- LEDs and buzzer indicate lock status and errors.
