# Project Definition

## High Level Description

This project is a smart deadbolt lock that provides secure access control, and is built around an Arduino microcontroller to enable access via a keypad and RFID reader. Our team aimed to design a cost-effective, reliable and user-friendly locking mechanism suitable for residential use.

## Purpose

This product provides the user with a convenient way of securing and accessing facilities through a user-friendly interface, allowing the deadbolt to be locked and unlocked through something you may have (RFID Scanner), or something you may know (keypad code), similar to MFA protocols used in cybersecurity operations. For example, some users would prefer not carrying around keys, and instead, would rather know a passcode to access a secured area. In addition, some may want to give others access to a secured area without having to meet them physically to give them keys, which is why the keypad code would provide a seamless access. Additionally, a concern would be giving someone temporary access to the secured area, which is why the RFID reader is also a considerable feature.

## Communication

This repository will serve as as a direct means of documentation as well as communication about the project, including a logbook where all changes, decisions, and contributions will be documented. 

## Scenarios

**User Interface:** The product would contain an RFID reader and programmed card for user input, a keypad for user input, a deadbolt latch, an LCD screen to output messages to a user, a buzzer to accompany ouput messages with sounds, a removable/changable battery, LEDs to indicate battery level, and all of this would be enclosed to fit a standardized door and latch size.

## Parameters 

To ensure user-friendly installation, the most common and standardized deadbolt size will be considered when creating the enclosure and latch. 
**Cross Bore Diameter:** 2-1/8"
**Backset:** 2-3/8"
**Latch Bore Diameter:** 1" 
**Total Weight:** 2.5lbs and under
