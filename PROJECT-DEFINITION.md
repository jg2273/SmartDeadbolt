## High Level Description

This project is a smart deadbolt lock that provides secure access control, and is built around an Arduino microcontroller to enable access via a keypad and RFID reader. Our team aimed to design a cost-effective, reliable and user-friendly locking mechanism suitable for residential use.

## Purpose

This product provides the user with a convenient way of securing and accessing facilities through a user-friendly interface, allowing the deadbolt to be locked and unlocked through something you may have (RFID Scanner), or something you may know (keypad code), similar to MFA protocols used in cybersecurity operations.
